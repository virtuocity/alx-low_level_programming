# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

## Notes
a **search algorithm** is an algorithm designed to solve a search problem. Search algorithms work to retrieve information stored within particular *data structure*, or calculated in the *search space* of a *problem domain*, with either *discrete or continuous values*.

Specific applications of search algorithms include:

+ Problems in [combinatorial optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_optimization), such as:
    + The [vehicle routing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_routing_problem) problem, a form of [shortest path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem) problem
The knapsack problem: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.
The nurse scheduling problem
Problems in constraint satisfaction, such as:
The map coloring problem
Filling in a sudoku or crossword puzzle
In game theory and especially combinatorial game theory, choosing the best move to make next (such as with the minmax algorithm)
Finding a combination or password from the whole set of possibilities
Factoring an integer (an important problem in cryptography)
Optimizing an industrial process, such as a chemical reaction, by changing the parameters of the process (like temperature, pressure, and pH)
Retrieving a record from a database
Finding the maximum or minimum value in a list or array
Checking to see if a given value is present in a set of values
