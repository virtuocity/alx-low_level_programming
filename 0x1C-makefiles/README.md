### What is make?
The make utility automatically determines which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled, and issues commands to recompile them.

You need a file called a makefile to tell make what to do. Most often, the makefile tells make how to compile and link a program.The makefile can also tell make how to run miscellaneous commands when explicitly asked (for example, to remove certain files as a clean-up operation).
