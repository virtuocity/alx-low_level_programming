# 0x15. C - File I/O 

## Notes 
In Unix and Unix-like computer operating systems, a file descriptor (FD, less frequently fildes) is a process-unique  
identifier (handle) for a file or other input/output resource, such as a pipe or network socket.  
File descriptors typically have non-negative integer values, with negative values being reserved to indicate "no value"  
or error conditions.  
File descriptors are a part of the POSIX API. Each Unix process (except perhaps daemons) should have three standard POSIX  
file descriptors, corresponding to the three standard streams:  
+ Standard input STDIN_FILENO  
+ Standard output STDOUT_FILENO
+ Standard Error STDERR_FILENO
