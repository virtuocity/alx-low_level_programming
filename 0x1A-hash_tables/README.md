# 0x1A. C - Hash tables
## Notes and Thoughts
A hash table is  a data structure that is used to store information. IN key - value pairs form. It is implemented using arrays and linked lists(when chainging). Key-value pairs can be , for example, a person's name and his/her phone number.  
Mapping of key-value pairs is done using a hash function.
The *Hash function* looks at a key and spits out what index it's going to store the info(key or value, or both??)  

    ```c
hash(key) -> index
```
